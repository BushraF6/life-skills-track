# TINY HABITS #

## Key Takeaways ##

- Analyze what you want to do (tiny behavior).
- Celebrate when you did your tiny behavior by saying things like “Bingo” or “I am awesome”.
- For long-term change there’re two ways:
  - 1. Change your environment.
  - 2. Do the tiny (unfamiliar) behavior you want with the existing (familiar) behavior.
- Three elements that cause behaviors are motivation; ability to do; and trigger.
- Format of creating a tiny habit:
  - After I ___(existing habit)___.
  - I will ___(new tiny behavior)___.
- Let the natural process emerge when you put your tiny behavior in the right spot and the right
spot is something you are already doing.

## BJ-FOGG Core Message - Key Takeaways ##

- BJ Fogg has discovered the universal formula human behavior, i.e. B=MAP where B
is behavior, M is motivation, A is ability and P is prompt.

- Tiny habits involve three parts:
  - 1. Shrink the behavior.
  - 2. Identify the action prompt.
  - 3. Grow your habit with some shine.

- Shrinking the behavior to the tiniest version will trick us to see it so small and we
easily get ready to do it as it needs less motivation.
- There are three types of prompts, and those are external prompts (also known as
context prompts) like notifications or alarms on your phone; Internal prompts (also
known as person prompts) like thoughts or emotions that remind you to act; and
Action prompts like completion of one behavior reminds you to do another.
- People often fail when they use external and internal prompts as they are disruptive
and demotivating. On the other hand, action prompts help a lot in triggering to do
the new tiny behavior after completion of the one action.
- BJ Fogg has termed shine as an authentic pride one gets after doing that small tiny
behavior. Celebrating after a small tiny win is the most critical component of habit
development.

## The Formula - B=MAP ##

- BJ Fogg has discovered the universal formula human behavior, i.e. B=MAP where B
is behavior, M is motivation, A is ability and P is prompt.
- When you want to do something very hard to do then you may need high
motivation for that. But when want to do something easy then you will need a low
amount of motivation to complete it.
- This is the reason why making the desired behavior into the tiniest version will need
low motivation which can be done easily without any effort while staying above the action line.

## Shine & Celebrate every tiny success ##

- BJ Fogg has termed “Shine” as an authentic pride one gets after doing that small tiny
behavior.
- Celebrating after a small tiny win is the most critical component of habit
development.
- Feeling successful at something even though it’s tiny will boost your confidence
and motivation. This will help you to perform related behaviors. This is termed as
success momentum which is created by the frequency of successes not by the size
of success.

## 1% Better Every Day ##

- James Clear said, “Habits are the compound interest of self-improvement”.
- Compounding can be amazingly powerful both positively and negatively if we leave
it to develop over a period of time.
- If we can get 1% better each day for a year we’ll end up 37 times better by the time
we are done.
- But if we get 1% worse each day for one year then we’ll go down nearly to zero. If
we keep this 1% error day after day then they’ll accumulate into larger problems.
- Time magnifies the margin between success and failure. It will multiply whatever
you feed it. Good habits make time your ally and bad habits make time your enemy.
