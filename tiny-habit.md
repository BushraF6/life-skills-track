# TINY HABITS #

## Key Takeaways ##

- Analyze what you want to do (tiny behavior).
- Celebrate when you did your tiny behavior by saying things like “Bingo” or “I am awesome”.
- For long-term change there’re two ways:
  - 1. Change your environment.
  - 2. Do the tiny (unfamiliar) behavior you want with the existing (familiar) behavior.
- Three elements that cause behaviors are motivation; ability to do; and trigger.
- Format of creating a tiny habit:
  - After I ___(existing habit)___.
  - I will ___(new tiny behavior)___.
- Let the natural process emerge when you put your tiny behavior in the right spot and the right
spot is something you are already doing.

## BJ-FOGG Core Message - Key Takeaways ##

- BJ Fogg has discovered the universal formula human behavior, i.e. B=MAP where B
is behavior, M is motivation, A is ability and P is prompt.

- Tiny habits involve three parts:
  - 1. Shrink the behavior.
  - 2. Identify the action prompt.
  - 3. Grow your habit with some shine.

- Shrinking the behavior to the tiniest version will trick us to see it so small and we
easily get ready to do it as it needs less motivation.
- There are three types of prompts, and those are external prompts (also known as
context prompts) like notifications or alarms on your phone; Internal prompts (also
known as person prompts) like thoughts or emotions that remind you to act; and
Action prompts like completion of one behavior reminds you to do another.
- People often fail when they use external and internal prompts as they are disruptive
and demotivating. On the other hand, action prompts help a lot in triggering to do
the new tiny behavior after completion of the one action.
- BJ Fogg has termed shine as an authentic pride one gets after doing that small tiny
behavior. Celebrating after a small tiny win is the most critical component of habit
development.

## The Formula - B=MAP ##

- BJ Fogg has discovered the universal formula human behavior, i.e. B=MAP where B
is behavior, M is motivation, A is ability and P is prompt.
- When you want to do something very hard to do then you may need high
motivation for that. But when want to do something easy then you will need a low
amount of motivation to complete it.
- This is the reason why making the desired behavior into the tiniest version will need
low motivation which can be done easily without any effort while staying above the action line.

## Shine & Celebrate every tiny success ##

- BJ Fogg has termed “Shine” as an authentic pride one gets after doing that small tiny
behavior.
- Celebrating after a small tiny win is the most critical component of habit
development.
- Feeling successful at something even though it’s tiny will boost your confidence
and motivation. This will help you to perform related behaviors. This is termed as
success momentum which is created by the frequency of successes not by the size
of success.

## 1% Better Every Day ##

- James Clear said, “Habits are the compound interest of self-improvement”.
- Compounding can be amazingly powerful both positively and negatively if we leave
it to develop over a period of time.
- If we can get 1% better each day for a year we’ll end up 37 times better by the time
we are done.
- But if we get 1% worse each day for one year then we’ll go down nearly to zero. If
we keep this 1% error day after day then they’ll accumulate into larger problems.
- Time magnifies the margin between success and failure. It will multiply whatever
you feed it. Good habits make time your ally and bad habits make time your enemy.

## Book Summary of Atomic Habits ##

### Habit Formation ###

There are three layers of behaviuor change:

- Outcomes: Concerns about changing the result.
- Processes: This relates to habits and the system.
- Identity: This is related to our beliefs.

Most of us work from outcome to identity rather than identity to outcome. The
ultimate form of intrinsic motivation is when a habit becomes a part of identity.

When we solve problems in terms of outcomes, we only solve them temporarily
but to solve problems in longer terms, we need to change our Identity.

### Make Good Habit Easier ###

By following the four laws of behavior change we can build good habits:

- Make it obvious: Keep the things that you need or remind you to do the
habit near to you (making it visible).
- Make it attractive: Make your good habit to be built so good and attractive
that you crave to do it.
- Make it easy: Reduce the friction between the thing which you need or
remind you to do the habit by keeping them near to you so you don’t need
more effort to go or to do it.
- Make it satisfying: We all love immediate rewards rather than delayed
rewards and what is immediately rewarded is repeated.

### Make Bad Habit Difficult ###

By following the four laws of behavior change we  can make bad habits difficult.

- Make it Invisible: Keep the things that you need or remind you to do the
bad habit far away from you (making it invisible).
- Make it ugly: Try to make the bad habit appear so ugly or bad that you won’t
like to do it.
- Make it hard: Increase the friction between the thing which you get or
remind you to do the bad habit by keeping them away from you so you
need more effort to go towards or to do it.
- Make it unsatisfying: We all hate punishments and what is immediately.

## Reflect ##

### Make Good Habit Obviuos and Satisfying ###

Working out is something I would really like to do but I often find myself procrastinating or
feeling lazy to do it so. But now I can apply those four laws:

- Make it obvious: Keep the things that I need or remind me to do the
workout near me. (Making it visible).
- Make it attractive: I can listen to my favorite podcast while I workout can
help me to make it appealing.
- Make it easy: Reduce the friction by keeping workout dress ready at night
and keeping it near so it reduces my effort to get ready and go to the gym.
- Make it satisfying: I can reward myself with delicious meals but will make
sure that would be healthy.

### Eliminate Bad Habit ###

Intake of junk or processed food is something I want to reduce or eliminate. But now I can
apply those four laws:

- Make it Invisible: Keep the chips, chocolates and all the junk food away
from my sight.
- Make it ugly: Research the facts or problems that are caused by junk foods
which would make me avoid it.
- Make it hard: Increase the friction between junk food so I would need more
effort to go towards or to do it.
- Make it unsatisfying: Keeping penalty of 20 minutes workout if I got my
hands into the bag of chips.
