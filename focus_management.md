## Deep Work ##

Deep work is “focusing without distraction on a cognitively demanding task.” The key is “focus” to deep work. Here, you spent lots of hours working on the work and are free of distractions.

## Optimal duration for Deep Work ##

Optimal duration for deep work is at least one hour. We can also go for 90 minutes but we should consider a break before we get exhausted. Deadlines are like motivational signals. You get the strong effect by saying this is the exact time you are going to work on something and you can handle your breaks and working time accordingly.

When we practice deep work we upgrade our brain and allow specific brain circuits to fire more effortlessly and effectively. This upgrade allows rapidly connecting ideas and uncovering creative solutions. In today’s economy, deep work is increasingly valuable as it helps in producing something great which spreads widely across the world and is increasingly rare as it demands undivided attention.

Here are three deep work strategies that you can incorporate into your
schedule:

1. Schedule distractions: Take a notepad and put down the next distraction
break you’ll have and hold your focus until that time.

2. Deep work ritual: Convert your deep work session into a simple regular habit. The goal is to consistently complete 4 hours of deep work per day at the same time each day. Morning is recommended for this period.
  
3. Evening shutdown: This involves making a plan to complete any unfinished
tasks the following day. Getting a series of steps lined out for the following
steps is enough to get things off your mind so you can ensure good and
adequate sleep which is crucial for deep work.
