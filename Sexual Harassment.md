## Actions to take ##

### Assess the situation ###

Understand and analyse whether intervening or taking a stand make the problem better or worse? Is there someone better suited to handle this situation?.

Step in, rather than aside. If it’s safe and necessary to do so, address the person doing the harassment. Be firm even if it is you. Let them know their behaviour is inappropriate.

### Distract ###

Create a distraction to help diffuse the situation if unable to intervene directly or get involved with other people around you. Ask them a question. Strike up a completely unrelated conversation. Tell them their boss is looking for them.

If you don’t want to get involved personally or unable to stop them, find an appropriate third party to intervene. This could be a manager, a supervisor, a human resource professional, another colleague, etc.
