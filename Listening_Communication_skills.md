# Listening and Active Communication #

## 1. Active Listening strategies ##

- Focus on the speaker; don’t get distracted by the thoughts racing in your mind.
- Don’t interrupt the person speaking, let them finish first and then respond.
- Show them your interest in the speaker’s topic by encouraging them to speak more. For example, say “That sounds interesting” or “Tell me more”.
- Use your body language to show you are listening to them.
- Make eye contact with the speaker.
- Paraphrase and summarize. This also ensures you and the speaker are on the same page.
- Ask questions to show your interest in the speaker’s topic.

## 2. Reflective Listening - Fisher's Model ##

- Listen more, talk less.
- Actively listening to the speaker. Remove all the distractions to pay full attention.
- Empathize the speaker's point of view, encouraging the speaker to speak freely without feeling judged.
- Avoid pretending like you have listened to them or show fake concerns.
- Focus on the speaker’s mood as well. This can be studied by their facial expressions, tone of their voice and other non-verbal cues.
- Summarize whatever the speaker has spoken. This will show that you are listening to them.
- Don’t give long or complex responses as this confuses the speaker. Stick to short and simple responses.

## 3. Obstacles in Listening Process ##

- There are usually two types of obstacles everyone faces called external and internal obstacles.
- External obstacles are like:
  - Distractions from sight.
  - Any external noise.
  - The physical environment and other things.
- These are much more manageable when compared to internal obstacles.
- Some of the internal obstacles are listed below:
  - Impatience can cause the listener to not focus on what the speaker is saying, and sometimes unintentionally reveals your lost interest in the speaker.
  - Anxiety doesn’t allow one to focus on what is being said to them and is found often competing with their own worries.
  - Boredom is caused by a lack of interest in the speaker's topic.
  - Mental laziness to process complex or detailed information the speaker is giving.

## 4. How to improve your listening skilss? ##

- Focus fully on the speaker, avoid making the speaker feel you aren’t listening by checking down your phone, daydream, looking here or there, or other negative signs.
- Listen more and speak less by avoiding interrupting the speaker. Best ways is to close your mouth as open mouth gives signal to the speaker that you want to interrupt, or simply write down on notes if you don’t want to lose any ideas you were about to say.
- Respond after they have finished speaking.
- Avoid jumping into conclusions or judging someone when they are speaking by agreeing and valueing their opinions or ideas.
- Show them that you are interested in listening to them more by using positive body language and saying phrases like “Yes”, “Really?” or “That sounds interesting”.
