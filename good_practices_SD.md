# SOFTWARE DEVELOPER - GOOD PRACTICES #

## Key Take Aways ##

- **Gathering Requirements**: Maintaining notes and having clarity by asking questions during discussions is important. Tools like Trello and Jira can be used for documentation which will act as a reference for future conversations and help to receive immediate feedback.
- **Always over-communicate**: If any requirements changed or implementation taking longer which may not meet current deadline, or any other problems are faced make sure to inform the relevant team members. Using group chat, not missing any call and keeping video on in meetings will help to improve communication.
- **Ask when stuck**: Explaining the problem clearly, mentioning the solutions you tried out to fix the problem will help to get you the answer. Tools like Loom, Github gists, Codepen, Codesandbox should be used to show your problem.
- **Get to know your teammates**: Making time for your teammates by finding out their work schedules, and calling when they are free and joining the meetings 5-10 minutes early to get some time with your team members.
- **Be aware and mindful of other team members**: When the team member isn't available to pick your call, send a single message listing all questions down. Be available when someone replies to your message and choose the communication medium depending on the situation.
- **Doing things with 100% involvement**: Having full concentration is a must. Healthy steps like exercising, the right amount of food and sleep towards productivity and concentration should be taken. Using apps like Timelimit, Freedom to block social media sites and apps like Boosted to track time helps in improving productivity.
